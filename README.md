# User Referral Program

Company XYZ has started a new referral program on Oct, 31. Each user who refers a new user
will get 10$ in credit when the new user buys something.

The program has been running for almost a month and the Growth Product Manager wants to
know if it's been successful. She is very excited cause, since the referral program started, the
company saw a spike in number of users and wants you to be able to give her some data she
can show to her boss.

Can you estimate the impact the program had on the site?

Based on the data, what would you suggest to do as a next step?

The referral program wasn't really tested in a rigorous way. It simply started on a given
day for all users and you are drawing conclusions by looking at the data before and after
the test started. What kinds of risks this approach presents? Can you think of a better
way to test the referral program and measure its impact?
